## **LAPTOP SHOP** - JS practice assignment
Hosted at Vercel(check website attached to project)

### Description 
This project was created as part of an Accelerated Learning course at Noroff. 
The goal of the project was to practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation and basics of fetching APIs. 

- The web page is split into four sections:
  * Section 1 shows the user a name and a bank balance, if the user has taken a loan the loan that needs to be payed back is also displayed.
    + To take a loan the user can press the "Get a loan" button. They will be prompted to enter an amount which needs to be maximum double of their bank balance.
  * Section 2 consists of a salary balance that increases by 100 every time the user presses the Work button. 
    + If the user clicks the Bank button after garnering a satisfying amount of salary it will get added to their bank balance.
    + If the user has a loan a new button will appear that will allow the user to spend their entire salary on paying back the loan. 
    + Otherwise 10% of the salary will be used to pay back the loan and the rest will be added to the bank balance.
  * Section 3 contains a select menu that displays a list of laptops fetched from an API. A description of the selected laptop is also displayed in this section.
  * Section 4 contains the name, image, price and the specs of the laptop. Here the user can buy the laptop if their bank balance allows it.
    + When buying the laptop an alert with tell the user they own a new laptop and the price of it is deducted from the bank balance.
